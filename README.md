# About
Adds lockable doors and autodoors to the game after appropriate research projects Door Locks for normal doors and Locking Autodoors for autodoors have been completed. Finally, your colonists can have a night of undisturbed sleep without needing to build a hallway if you don't want to!

I was inspired to create this mod after my colonists kept entering other colonist's rooms to use their furniture, and installing other mods that added hygiene and bladder requirements which prompted me to build ensuites.
